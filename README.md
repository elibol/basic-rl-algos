# Reinforcement Learning Algorithms #

Although this repository contains executable code, it is primarily intent for educational purposes. Includes SARSA, Q-Learning, RMAX, and Thompson Sampling. Agents may interact with environments via the interact interface (see `AgentBase` in `agents.py`).

### TODO ###
* Create example domain which can interface with RL agents.
