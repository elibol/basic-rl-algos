# Reinforcement Learning Algorithms #

*Although the modules in this library are self-contained, tested, and correct, they are primarily intended for educational purposes. Additional code which originally accompanied these modules is not included.*

Includes SARSA, Q-Learning, RMAX, and Thompson Sampling. Agents may interact with environments via the interact interface (see `AgentBase` in `agents.py`).

### TODO ###
* Create example domain which can interface with RL agents.
